# Honkai: Star Rail Simple Game dlc:
This repository provides code for a simple dlc for the game Honkai Star Rail. For informational purposes only. Use at your own risk.


This DLC version has performance and rendering issues, as well as problems with network connectivity. In my opinion, the author went too far.

To use the old version, you can change the path in cfg.ini by specifying the path to Star-Rail-GC.dll:
DllPath = C:\HSR-inject-main\HSR-injector\Star-Rail-GC.dll

Or simply rename Star-Rail-GC.dll to ACE-DRV.dll.
You can download the latest release at https://github.com/assBuk/HSR-inject/releases.
